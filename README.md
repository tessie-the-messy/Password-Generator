# Password-Generator

## Description
This repo contains a website application to generate a randomized password. It was created using a starter code (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet). The final product allows users to choose how long they want their password to be (between 8 and 128 characters), as well as which types of characters they want it to contain (i.e. Uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, numbers). Users make these choices through alerts that appear at the top of the webpage.

For future versions of this application, it may be more useful to create a form for the user to fill out in order to generate the passowrd.

## Usage
For use by the general public.
